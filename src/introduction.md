# Introduction

## General overview
There are too many problems yet too little solutions. Today's media is dominated by doomsday preachers and whining commentators who
don't hold back on spreading terror but provide no answers to the problems they discuss. I seek to change that with this book.
To be specific, I want to use this book to point out the most important issues I see in my country, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, and give reason to my solutions for these problems. I also hope to achieve this while writing in a
clear and concise way wherever possible.

## My views
Before starting the main body of the book, I will clarify some of my general views. I consider myself a classical liberal, believing
in the free market, low taxes, the rights of the individual, the rule of law and freedom of speech. However, in regards to the economic
side of liberalism, I do believe that protectionist policies are sometimes necessary to prevent the nation from becoming a slave to
another state.

To clarify as I won't be speaking much on this in the remainder of the book, while I do believe in the rights of the LGBTQ+ and trans populations, 
I firmly hold the position that there is a line where these groups shift away from the real world and enter lala-land. In regards 
to the trans population, the idea of being born in the wrong body is true, however the idea that you can be no gender at all 
(non-binary) among other things is absurd to me. I also do not advocate for the education of these ideas to young people under
the age of 16 as I believe that before then it can easily create confusion for the average child.

The rest of my views will be discussed throughout this book.

Note from 12/02/2023: Since I started writing this book my views have shifted. I have discovered libertarianism which I find myself
aligned to. I want to create a model of libertarianism which still includes somewhat of a welfare system and state spending while
implementing as many libertarian principles as possible.

## Closing statement
Thank you for starting this book, I hope it finds you well.
