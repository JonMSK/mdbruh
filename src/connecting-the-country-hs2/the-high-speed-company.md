# "The High-Speed Company"

## The proposal of multiple shareholders
### Overview
Drawing from the historical example of the Suez company and research of government funding of the HS2 projects, I believe it would
be in the government's interest to estimate the completed value of the HS2 per stage once completed and use this value to price shares which would
be issued for various stakeholders to purchase. I would make the point that these deals are done privately as issuing public shares allows any business
to purchase a portion of a critical infastructure project.

Each phase would be constructed after the other to avoid confusion and make management far easier and cheaper. Prior to beginning construction, a period
of funding would begin where shares are offered to private companies who enter into talks with the company. Should they purchase any shares, the capital
will be used by the company to finance the construction of that stage. Different stages will be of different importance, provide differring levels of
revenue, and be more or less popular with potential shareholders. Including a dividend yield would be very sensible as to attract greater levels of
interest and investment. The government would always retain a majority (>50%) holding in the company.

### Benefits
While the issuing of shares may not give the company 100% of the investment they need to fund the entire project, it will likely be a great contribution
to the project with minimal downside. Aside from cutting initial costs, the implementation of a joint-stock business owned by it's shareholders produces
greater efficiency in business operations as the company has a profit motivation from it's shareholders to produce good quarterly results.

### Drawbacks
One may question the problems arising from private investors owning key infastructure. This issue is countered in my plan/overview above where I state
that despite the issuing of shares to various private owners, the UK government would still retain a majority holding of the company, granting them control
over company decisions and allowing them to block the decisions of other shareholders. Even if all other shareholders voted against/for a decision, the UK
government would have the power to block it. Aside from this I fail to see any other issues with the plan.

I also do not personally believe there is much wrong with private companies holding some key infastructure: as we have seen in the past with old public
government operations being converted into private companies many begin to run at greater efficiency and provide a better service while still having to
maintain costs that appeal to the consumer due to the added profit incentive that public sector industry lacks.

## To conclude
The plan to issue shares of the HS2 project has multiple benefits and few drawbacks. These benefits have the power to save the UK taxpayer billions and even
potentially earn them money in the future provided the company does return a profit. I see no reason why the UK government would not implement a plan like
this immediately. The government needs to act now through using my plan and using the capital collected to pay for the contracts they have started or rehaul
the project alltogether with new contracts (although this is a far more extreme method).
