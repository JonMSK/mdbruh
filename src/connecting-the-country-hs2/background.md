# Background

## Suez Company
In 1858, French diplomat and businessman Ferdinand de Lesseps, founded the Suez Company. The company operated in the structure of a joint-stock company
owned by shareholders. Funds, businesses or other people/entities were able to purchase and own a portion of the company's shares. The company itself
was responsible for the construction and operation of the Suez Canal. Initially the shares were mainly split between French investors and the Egyptian
Pasha family. However, due to financial stress, the Egyptian family would have to offload their shares to the government of the UK in 1875. The Suez
Company met it's fate when Egyptian president Nasser nationalised the company. His actions would later lead to war and a global diplomatic crisis.

TLDR; the Suez Company was a joint-stock company which sold shares to finance the construction of the Suez Canal, one of the most important (if not
the most) trade routes in the world.
