# Privatisation
## The problem
So clearly, the problem lies in the forced fee. And so a solution to this problem would be to remove the
fee. That way ordinary people won't be forced to pay for a service which they may not even use. However,
this does not solve the problem. The government still has to pay for the BBC because it's a state-sponsored
service and the money has to come from somewhere. Generally, the government raises money via taxation but
doing this completely removes the point of getting rid of the TV tax. The cost is offloaded once again
onto the citizen but with more stealth this time. What do we do?

## The solution
Privatise it. Simple, sell the BBC to a private shareholder or group of shareholders and take the service
off the government's books. The privatisation would be done quickly to help people cover increased expenses
in a year where it will likely be needed most. I highly doubt many would actually miss it, of course there
will be people claiming its a "national treasure" and "important history of this country" but the fact remains:
it is outdated, overfunded, inefficient and authoritarian. With the BBC in private hands, a new, business
motivated owner will take action to reform the service and eliminate inefficiencies while transforming the BBC
into a modern competitive broadcasting service. Who knows, the BBC could even end up being a leading international
company serving users all across the globe as opposed to the small fraction of the world here who are forced to pay.

## The result
The privatisation of the BBC and the subsequent elimination of the TV license tax would be a major win
for liberty in this country. It seems like for years we have suffocated our people and our businesses with
new liberty-violating taxes and legislation and so this would be great leap for the UK towards a freer
society.

From 2022 to 2023, the government has pledged all households a total handout of £400 to help cover the cost of
rising energy bills. In 2021, there were [28.1 million households](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2021#:~:text=There%20were%20an%20estimated%2028.1%20million%20households%20in%20the%20UK%20in%202021%2C%20an%20increase%20of%206.3%25%20over%20the%20last%2010%20years.)
in the United Kingdom. This number would have since likely increased, but we will still use this data nonetheless.
Using these statistics, we can calculate that the total cost of the government's energy relief package is in the
region of £11.24bn. Through my proposal to privatise the BBC, the government could increase the relief per household
by 39.75% without borrowing any more money for the fiscal year. This is a huge increase for little work which I
believe would be greatly beneficial to our country and a major win for the government which implements it.
