# Overview
## Quick citation note.
Most of the information here is taken from the [website of the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/tv-licence) and the wikipedia page for [TV licensing in the
United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom#History) which cites many other
sources including the TV licensing website itself..

## What is a TV license?
In 1968, Harold Wilson's Labour government of the UK imposed a television tax for colour and monochrome television users.
The fee, adjusted for inflation, was £184.5 per household per year. As of the February 4 2023, [a TV license costs
£159 for colour TVs and £53.50 for monochrome TVs](https://www.gov.uk/tv-licence) (not that there are many around anymore,
this only shows how outdated this tax is).

If a household fails to pay their TV tax and has been found guilty of it they can be fined up to £1,000.

## Who does TV licensing tax apply to?
In short, the government will find some way to force you to pay for a TV license. If you:
 - watch live TV
 - watch a streaming service
 - record media from a streaming service
 - watch YouTube, Amazon, Now, Sky Go, or the BBC

and this is through any device capable of it, not just a television.

Although the law does state that you must pay if you watch something being aired on live TV, TV license collection
services are known to be militant and to harass people with threateaning and intimidating letters
if they do not own a license, meaning most will end up paying for one even if they just stream
Netflix.

## Where is the tax used?
According to the [BBC 2021/22 annual report](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/annualreport/ara-2021-22.pdf),
the BBC's license tax income was £3.8bn and operated with a £206mn surplus. The BBC's total income was £5.33bn.
