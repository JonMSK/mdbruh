# Liberty

## A threat to our freedom to choose
In my opinion, the UK's TV license tax is a major threat to our own individual liberty.
The live streaming system of using media is a simple pleasure of our modern lives and I
see it as wrong for the government to enforce a taxation on people to use this great
invention. A TV licensing tax takes away the individual freedom to choose our media service
which I see as wrong.

Being a strong believer in personal liberty I see many taxes as immoral and a
threat, although I can still justify some taxes.

We must still have a government which manages aspects of our country and maintains a 
competitive capitalist system to drive our economy and this does require funding, however,
I cannot get my head around having a TV licensing tax, especially when the content you
are paying for is of insufficient quality for the price.

## The state of the BBC
### BBC TV services
The video media the BBC provides to the UK is completely unreasonable for what our citizens are
paying. In 2022, for your £159 per year (£13.25 per month) you got a variety of documentaries,
sports events, Doctor Who, Peaky Blinders among other shows produced by the BBC. Wow, seems like
a lot right?

Netflix is a paid live streaming service which currently costs £6.99 per month for
unlimited films and TV in HD with no adverts and downloads. For people who cannot afford this,
Netflix also offers a cheaper plan which is £4.99 per month but includes advertising. Netflix's
2022 releases included Stranger Things season 4, Wednesday, Dahmer, The Sandman, Formula 1 DTS,
and more. Netflix also continues to offer a range of multi-million dollar movies and shows including
Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Good Will Hunting, American Made, and more. All for £6.99.
More than the BBC and for less.

### BBC News services
While I can admit the BBC does provide rapid (every 30 minutes I believe) TV news and also
an online news website, it does not take a government-owned, taxpayer-funded group to provide
live news coverage. Many free news services exist both live on TV and on the internet which
provide high-quality news and other paid services also exist which provide different types of news
to different qualities, creating a market of competitiveness for news services. For example, we
have an open market of business news companies such as Bloomberg and Business Insider which specialise
in this kind of information.

### BBC Radio services
Again, while I can admit I myself have used the BBC radio service in the past, however, I generally
use a paid-for streaming service such as Spotify or Amazon Music Unlimited to stream music that I
personally enjoy. Actually, Spotify and Amazon have actually started offerring radio-like streaming
services for their users without the presenters inbetween, effectively replacing/improving them. We
do not, with the availability of cheap music services, need a nationalised radio station, especially
when the music it provides is typically repeated multiple times in a day.

## TLDR
In short, I think it is immoral for the government to expect people to have to contribute
to a public body that may not even provide a good level of service for their fee. I
see the TV tax as a violent dictator attempting to divide and conquer our personal
liberties to pick and choose the media we consume and in-turn pay for.
