# Final words
I honestly cannot get my head around why the government does not take action to privatise the BBC
immediately and relieve people of this burden. It's incredibly easy to see that the old service has
had it's time and that we must move on from old traditions. In a time of great economic uncertainty,
where government debt and inflation are at all time highs this is one of the most logical things the
government could do to help people from the highest to the lowest classes. And this tax, do remember,
**affects the poorest the most.**
