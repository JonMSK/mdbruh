<h2 id="general-overview"><a class="header" href="#general-overview">General overview</a></h2>
<p>There are too many problems yet too little solutions. Today's media is dominated by doomsday preachers and whining commentators who
don't hold back on spreading terror but provide no answers to the problems they discuss. I seek to change that with this book.
To be specific, I want to use this book to point out the most important issues I see in my country, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, and give reason to my solutions for these problems. I also hope to achieve this while writing in a
clear and concise way wherever possible.</p>
<h2 id="my-views"><a class="header" href="#my-views">My views</a></h2>
<p>Before starting the main body of the book, I will clarify some of my general views. I consider myself a classical liberal, believing
in the free market, low taxes, the rights of the individual, the rule of law and freedom of speech. However, in regards to the economic
side of liberalism, I do believe that protectionist policies are sometimes necessary to prevent the nation from becoming a slave to
another state.</p>
<p>To clarify as I won't be speaking much on this in the remainder of the book, while I do believe in the rights of the LGBTQ+ and trans populations, 
I firmly hold the position that there is a line where these groups shift away from the real world and enter lala-land. In regards 
to the trans population, the idea of being born in the wrong body is true, however the idea that you can be no gender at all 
(non-binary) among other things is absurd to me. I also do not advocate for the education of these ideas to young people under
the age of 16 as I believe that before then it can easily create confusion for the average child.</p>
<p>The rest of my views will be discussed throughout this book.</p>
<p>Note from 12/02/2023: Since I started writing this book my views have shifted. I have discovered libertarianism which I find myself
aligned to. I want to create a model of libertarianism which still includes somewhat of a welfare system and state spending while
implementing as many libertarian principles as possible.</p>
<h2 id="closing-statement"><a class="header" href="#closing-statement">Closing statement</a></h2>
<p>Thank you for starting this book, I hope it finds you well.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="connecting-the-country-hs2"><a class="header" href="#connecting-the-country-hs2">Connecting the country: HS2</a></h1>
<p>This chapter will cover the United Kingdom's High Speed 2 project. I hope to give you a clear grounding in what the project is,
my views of the current state of it and how I think it could be improved.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>HS2, or High Speed 2, is a planned railway project linking various key cities of England together. I do specify England here as the plan does not yet involve an extension to Scotland or Wales. It encompasses an ambitious plan to construct a large stretch of high speed rail line which, if completed to the planned standard, will be the fastest high speed railway line in Europe with a top speed of 225mph. They will also be fully electric which allows for flexibility in regards to future climate emissions goals.</p>
<p>To clarify, the HS2 project will link London and Birmingham (Phase 1), Birmingham and Crewe (Phase 2a) and Crewe and Manchester (Phase 2b) (+ Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway in Phase 2b). A plan was also created to link Birmingham to Leeds, however this has since been cancelled.</p>
<p>Despite the many benefits of the HS2 plan, the government routinely comes under fire for the costs of implementing it. The contract system being run by the government is seen as highly inefficient and, due to current economic trends and governmental budget trends, the project will likely be financed with government borrowing, a worrying trend that lies outside of the scope of this chapter. Personally, I believe the government financing idea to be inefficient and prone to exploitation from the companies involved.</p>
<p>Even though these issues do exist, ultimately, the project has a lot of positives and few (although great) negatives. We should not allow the negatives to overshadow the positives of the HS2. It has the power to link people hundreds of miles apart, shorten commuting times allowing people from all over the UK to widen their job range decreasing unemployment, set a global standard for green travel, and more.</p>
<p>I personally believe that by using simple business practices (ie running the HS2 as if it were a company motivated by profit, not a government sector) the UK government can dramatically reduce the cost of running the HS2 and the inefficiency of it. In this chapter, I will be outlining some of the amendments to the plan I believe would be very beneficial to the government and the UK taxpayer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h1>
<h2 id="suez-company"><a class="header" href="#suez-company">Suez Company</a></h2>
<p>In 1858, French diplomat and businessman Ferdinand de Lesseps, founded the Suez Company. The company operated in the structure of a joint-stock company
owned by shareholders. Funds, businesses or other people/entities were able to purchase and own a portion of the company's shares. The company itself
was responsible for the construction and operation of the Suez Canal. Initially the shares were mainly split between French investors and the Egyptian
Pasha family. However, due to financial stress, the Egyptian family would have to offload their shares to the government of the UK in 1875. The Suez
Company met it's fate when Egyptian president Nasser nationalised the company. His actions would later lead to war and a global diplomatic crisis.</p>
<p>TLDR; the Suez Company was a joint-stock company which sold shares to finance the construction of the Suez Canal, one of the most important (if not
the most) trade routes in the world.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-the-hs2"><a class="header" href="#cost-of-the-hs2">Cost of the HS2</a></h2>
<p>The HS2 project is split into 3 stages, Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b.
According to the <a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/what-is-hs2/hs2-funding/">HS2 website</a>, the budget of Phase 1 is 44.6bn GBP (including contingency capital of 9.6bn), the budget of Phase 2a is 5.2-7.2bn GBP
and the budget of Phase 2b is 13bn to 19bn GBP. According to the government's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/high-speed-two-6-monthly-report-to-parliament-october-2022">HS2 6-monthly report for October 2022</a>,
the total budget for Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b is between 53-71bn GBP.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-high-speed-company"><a class="header" href="#the-high-speed-company">&quot;The High-Speed Company&quot;</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-proposal-of-multiple-shareholders"><a class="header" href="#the-proposal-of-multiple-shareholders">The proposal of multiple shareholders</a></h2>
<h3 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h3>
<p>Drawing from the historical example of the Suez company and research of government funding of the HS2 projects, I believe it would
be in the government's interest to estimate the completed value of the HS2 per stage once completed and use this value to price shares which would
be issued for various stakeholders to purchase. I would make the point that these deals are done privately as issuing public shares allows any business
to purchase a portion of a critical infastructure project.</p>
<p>Each phase would be constructed after the other to avoid confusion and make management far easier and cheaper. Prior to beginning construction, a period
of funding would begin where shares are offered to private companies who enter into talks with the company. Should they purchase any shares, the capital
will be used by the company to finance the construction of that stage. Different stages will be of different importance, provide differring levels of
revenue, and be more or less popular with potential shareholders. Including a dividend yield would be very sensible as to attract greater levels of
interest and investment. The government would always retain a majority (&gt;50%) holding in the company.</p>
<h3 id="benefits"><a class="header" href="#benefits">Benefits</a></h3>
<p>While the issuing of shares may not give the company 100% of the investment they need to fund the entire project, it will likely be a great contribution
to the project with minimal downside. Aside from cutting initial costs, the implementation of a joint-stock business owned by it's shareholders produces
greater efficiency in business operations as the company has a profit motivation from it's shareholders to produce good quarterly results.</p>
<h3 id="drawbacks"><a class="header" href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h3>
<p>One may question the problems arising from private investors owning key infastructure. This issue is countered in my plan/overview above where I state
that despite the issuing of shares to various private owners, the UK government would still retain a majority holding of the company, granting them control
over company decisions and allowing them to block the decisions of other shareholders. Even if all other shareholders voted against/for a decision, the UK
government would have the power to block it. Aside from this I fail to see any other issues with the plan.</p>
<p>I also do not personally believe there is much wrong with private companies holding some key infastructure: as we have seen in the past with old public
government operations being converted into private companies many begin to run at greater efficiency and provide a better service while still having to
maintain costs that appeal to the consumer due to the added profit incentive that public sector industry lacks.</p>
<h2 id="to-conclude"><a class="header" href="#to-conclude">To conclude</a></h2>
<p>The plan to issue shares of the HS2 project has multiple benefits and few drawbacks. These benefits have the power to save the UK taxpayer billions and even
potentially earn them money in the future provided the company does return a profit. I see no reason why the UK government would not implement a plan like
this immediately. The government needs to act now through using my plan and using the capital collected to pay for the contracts they have started or rehaul
the project alltogether with new contracts (although this is a far more extreme method).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tv-license-tax"><a class="header" href="#tv-license-tax">TV License Tax</a></h1>
<p>This chapter will cover the United Kingdom's TV tax. Specifically, what it is and my opinion on it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview-2"><a class="header" href="#overview-2">Overview</a></h1>
<h2 id="quick-citation-note"><a class="header" href="#quick-citation-note">Quick citation note.</a></h2>
<p>Most of the information here is taken from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tv-licence">website of the UK government</a> and the wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom#History">TV licensing in the
United Kingdom</a> which cites many other
sources including the TV licensing website itself..</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-tv-license"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-tv-license">What is a TV license?</a></h2>
<p>In 1968, Harold Wilson's Labour government of the UK imposed a television tax for colour and monochrome television users.
The fee, adjusted for inflation, was £184.5 per household per year. As of the February 4 2023, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tv-licence">a TV license costs
£159 for colour TVs and £53.50 for monochrome TVs</a> (not that there are many around anymore,
this only shows how outdated this tax is).</p>
<p>If a household fails to pay their TV tax and has been found guilty of it they can be fined up to £1,000.</p>
<h2 id="who-does-tv-licensing-tax-apply-to"><a class="header" href="#who-does-tv-licensing-tax-apply-to">Who does TV licensing tax apply to?</a></h2>
<p>In short, the government will find some way to force you to pay for a TV license. If you:</p>
<ul>
<li>watch live TV</li>
<li>watch a streaming service</li>
<li>record media from a streaming service</li>
<li>watch YouTube, Amazon, Now, Sky Go, or the BBC</li>
</ul>
<p>and this is through any device capable of it, not just a television.</p>
<p>Although the law does state that you must pay if you watch something being aired on live TV, TV license collection
services are known to be militant and to harass people with threateaning and intimidating letters
if they do not own a license, meaning most will end up paying for one even if they just stream
Netflix.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-tax-used"><a class="header" href="#where-is-the-tax-used">Where is the tax used?</a></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/annualreport/ara-2021-22.pdf">BBC 2021/22 annual report</a>,
the BBC's license tax income was £3.8bn and operated with a £206mn surplus. The BBC's total income was £5.33bn.</p>

<h2 id="a-threat-to-our-freedom-to-choose"><a class="header" href="#a-threat-to-our-freedom-to-choose">A threat to our freedom to choose</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, the UK's TV license tax is a major threat to our own individual liberty.
The live streaming system of using media is a simple pleasure of our modern lives and I
see it as wrong for the government to enforce a taxation on people to use this great
invention. A TV licensing tax takes away the individual freedom to choose our media service
which I see as wrong.</p>
<p>Being a strong believer in personal liberty I see many taxes as immoral and a
threat, although I can still justify some taxes.</p>
<p>We must still have a government which manages aspects of our country and maintains a 
competitive capitalist system to drive our economy and this does require funding, however,
I cannot get my head around having a TV licensing tax, especially when the content you
are paying for is of insufficient quality for the price.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-the-bbc"><a class="header" href="#the-state-of-the-bbc">The state of the BBC</a></h2>
<h3 id="bbc-tv-services"><a class="header" href="#bbc-tv-services">BBC TV services</a></h3>
<p>The video media the BBC provides to the UK is completely unreasonable for what our citizens are
paying. In 2022, for your £159 per year (£13.25 per month) you got a variety of documentaries,
sports events, Doctor Who, Peaky Blinders among other shows produced by the BBC. Wow, seems like
a lot right?</p>
<p>Netflix is a paid live streaming service which currently costs £6.99 per month for
unlimited films and TV in HD with no adverts and downloads. For people who cannot afford this,
Netflix also offers a cheaper plan which is £4.99 per month but includes advertising. Netflix's
2022 releases included Stranger Things season 4, Wednesday, Dahmer, The Sandman, Formula 1 DTS,
and more. Netflix also continues to offer a range of multi-million dollar movies and shows including
Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Good Will Hunting, American Made, and more. All for £6.99.
More than the BBC and for less.</p>
<h3 id="bbc-news-services"><a class="header" href="#bbc-news-services">BBC News services</a></h3>
<p>While I can admit the BBC does provide rapid (every 30 minutes I believe) TV news and also
an online news website, it does not take a government-owned, taxpayer-funded group to provide
live news coverage. Many free news services exist both live on TV and on the internet which
provide high-quality news and other paid services also exist which provide different types of news
to different qualities, creating a market of competitiveness for news services. For example, we
have an open market of business news companies such as Bloomberg and Business Insider which specialise

<p>Again, while I can admit I myself have used the BBC radio service in the past, however, I generally
use a paid-for streaming service such as Spotify or Amazon Music Unlimited to stream music that I
personally enjoy. Actually, Spotify and Amazon have actually started offerring radio-like streaming
services for their users without the presenters inbetween, effectively replacing/improving them. We
do not, with the availability of cheap music services, need a nationalised radio station, especially
when the music it provides is typically repeated multiple times in a day.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><a class="header" href="#tldr">TLDR</a></h2>
<p>In short, I think it is immoral for the government to expect people to have to contribute
to a public body that may not even provide a good level of service for their fee. I
see the TV tax as a violent dictator attempting to divide and conquer our personal
liberties to pick and choose the media we consume and in-turn pay for.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem"><a class="header" href="#the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>So clearly, the problem lies in the forced fee. And so a solution to this problem would be to remove the
fee. That way ordinary people won't be forced to pay for a service which they may not even use. However,
this does not solve the problem. The government still has to pay for the BBC because it's a state-sponsored
service and the money has to come from somewhere. Generally, the government raises money via taxation but
doing this completely removes the point of getting rid of the TV tax. The cost is offloaded once again
onto the citizen but with more stealth this time. What do we do?</p>
<h2 id="the-solution"><a class="header" href="#the-solution">The solution</a></h2>
<p>Privatise it. Simple, sell the BBC to a private shareholder or group of shareholders and take the service
off the government's books. The privatisation would be done quickly to help people cover increased expenses
in a year where it will likely be needed most. I highly doubt many would actually miss it, of course there
will be people claiming its a &quot;national treasure&quot; and &quot;important history of this country&quot; but the fact remains:
it is outdated, overfunded, inefficient and authoritarian. With the BBC in private hands, a new, business
motivated owner will take action to reform the service and eliminate inefficiencies while transforming the BBC
into a modern competitive broadcasting service. Who knows, the BBC could even end up being a leading international
company serving users all across the globe as opposed to the small fraction of the world here who are forced to pay.</p>
<h2 id="the-result"><a class="header" href="#the-result">The result</a></h2>
<p>The privatisation of the BBC and the subsequent elimination of the TV license tax would be a major win
for liberty in this country. It seems like for years we have suffocated our people and our businesses with
new liberty-violating taxes and legislation and so this would be great leap for the UK towards a freer
society.</p>
<p>From 2022 to 2023, the government has pledged all households a total handout of £400 to help cover the cost of
rising energy bills. In 2021, there were <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2021#:~:text=There%20were%20an%20estimated%2028.1%20million%20households%20in%20the%20UK%20in%202021%2C%20an%20increase%20of%206.3%25%20over%20the%20last%2010%20years.">28.1 million households</a>
in the United Kingdom. This number would have since likely increased, but we will still use this data nonetheless.
Using these statistics, we can calculate that the total cost of the government's energy relief package is in the
region of £11.24bn. Through my proposal to privatise the BBC, the government could increase the relief per household
by 39.75% without borrowing any more money for the fiscal year. This is a huge increase for little work which I
believe would be greatly beneficial to our country and a major win for the government which implements it.</p>

<p>I honestly cannot get my head around why the government does not take action to privatise the BBC
immediately and relieve people of this burden. It's incredibly easy to see that the old service has
had it's time and that we must move on from old traditions. In a time of great economic uncertainty,
where government debt and inflation are at all time highs this is one of the most logical things the
government could do to help people from the highest to the lowest classes. And this tax, do remember,
<strong>affects the poorest the most.</strong></p>
